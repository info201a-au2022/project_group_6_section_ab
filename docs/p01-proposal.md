## Abstract
Our main question is how often does suicide occur within the United States? We are concerned with the fact that due to many changes within recent years, the rates of suicide have increased immensely. To address this concern, we plan to take a closer look at suicide rates to bring awareness to mental health.

## Keywords
**Suicide** death caused by injuring oneself with the intent to die.

**Mental health** a person’s condition with regard to their psychological and emotional well-being

**Social wellbeing** a sense of belonging to a community and making a contribution to society

## Introduction
Do you think it’s normal for more than 700,000 people to commit suicide a year? A sad truth about today’s day in age is that suicide is the fourth leading cause of death for people 15-29 years-old. The only way we can change this and protect each other is by talking about these hard topics and being there for one another. It is very important for people to understand how much of an impact this has on our society as a whole. Whenever someone does commit suicide there are many more people who will attempt. In order to make a change and get people the help they need we need to shed light on this and have those hard conversations so that one day there can be a major change.

## Problem Domain
What are the main reasons people have poor mental health? Social media plays a large role in the decrease of users' mental health. Therefore, the topic that our group decided to tackle is the impact of mental health due to a social media setting. Our project will be structured in a way where we will display various statistics and data sets including the increased usage of social media over the years, cyberbullying, the mental health of teens, and negative effects of social media on the mental health of U.S. teens.

Our team’s values align with this research topic because bringing awareness to mental health is something we feel strongly about. This is due to the fact that first hand, we as teens, have experienced various losses due to cyberbullying and poor mental health. According to S.Dixon article about “Teen perspectives on negative effects of social media in the U.S. 2018”,  studies show the leading reasons why teenagers ultimately feel as though social media has a negative impact on their lives. According to his statistics the leading causes for teen depression is caused by bullying/spreading rumors through the use of social media. We believe that a large reason as to why suicide rates have increased and why the mental health of teens have worsened over the years is due to the increased usage of social media and how prominent it is within our lives.

Direct stakeholders in regards to the correlation between mental health and social media could include other students, teens, social media users, and etc. On the other hand, indirect stakeholders, and people who are impacted without use would be families of teenagers, friends, and etc.

Possible harms to not tackling the issue in regards to the correlation between mental health and social media could be kept a silent issue. Many times these loved ones/close friends also experience feelings of shock, anger, guilt, symptoms of depression or anxiety. It is important that we bring awareness to this subject because too many lives are being impacted by social media in a negative way. The benefit to discussing this topic is that awareness and attention is brought to this subject.

## Research questions
**_What age group has the highest suicide rate?_**
The question, “What age group has the highest suicide rate?” is an important topic to cover because it is detrimental that our group takes a closer look into what age group is suffering the most from poor mental health. This question is motivated by the want to find a solution for a specific age group in order to lessen the number of suicides within this specific age groups, since it is the age that is most impacted.

**_Is suicide more common in the male or female population?_**
The question, “Is suicide more common in the male or female population?” is an important topic to cover because it is necessary to narrow down the population in which suicide has a greater occurance. This question is motivated by the want to know whether or not a certain female or male genetic trait is the reason for a increase amount of deaths by suicide. From here, we are able to do some research and test our theory based on the data analysis.

**_What is the trend of suicide rates over the past few years?_**
The question, “What is the trend of the suicide rates over the past few years?” is an important topic to cover because we need to highlight the fact that suicide is a growing issue within our community. This question is motivated by the want to know whether or not the events within recent years have triggered more poor mental health and deaths by suicide.

## The Dataset
Our dataset specifically focuses on long-time trends of suicide rates between different countries. Suicide cases has been a prevalent issue within countries worldwide; not excluding the U.S. There are many factors that could lead or motivate an individual to commit suicide. These factors can be both social or political. Mental health is an important issue to recognize. Recognizing these rates allows others to be aware of the trends that could be increasing and how we can make plans of actions to decrease these trends. Our problem domain is to specifically focus on suicide rates within the U.S; which leads us to question and compare the trends of suicide over the years and potentially what its leading factors. Our dataset provides us with important information, alongside suicide rates, the years, sex group, age range, and population of the country. In order for us to be able to answer our research questions, these variables of data provided from our dataset are essential in being able to compare trending rates. With these variables we can specifically determine if suicide rates are more prevalent in relation to certain age groups, genders, or country. Overall, our goal is to fulfill the purpose of our dataset by spreading awareness towards these issues.

| [WHO Suicide Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/szamil/who-suicide-statistics?resource=download) | |Year | Age | Suicides_no | Population |
| -----------| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------| ---------- |
| Countries | 43776 | 43776 | 43776 | 43776 | 43776


**Who collected the data?**:
WHO (World Health Organization)

**When?**:
2018

**For what purpose?**:
To observe where the the world as a whole was heading and whether it is getting worse or better in terms of suicide trends.

**How was the data collection effort funded?**:
WHO is funded by two main sources; Accessed contribution (AC) and voluntary contributions. Accessed contributions are made by countries who are members of the organization. While, voluntary contributions are made by regular members, philanthropist foundations, etc.

**Who is likely to benefit from the data or make money?**:
The creators, WHO, are more likely to benefit/make money from the data. This is because they are directly taking the donations to fund their collections. All though in hand, by funding these data collections, users are able to obtain information. Though, directly, WHO is being benefitted.

**How was the data validated and held secure?**:
They World Health Organization validate their data by collecting data from population-based sources such as, house-hold surveys, etc. and institution-based sources such as, health facilities, etc.

**Is it credible and trustworthy?**:
Yes this dataset is both credible and trustworthy. This dataset comes from a health research organization that focuses on health in general. The credibility can also be validated by their usage of multiple sources and expansion to different aspects of data that does not restrict them from potential limitations.

**How did you obtain the data?**:
We obtained the data by searching through the Kaggle database for data regarding suicide rates.

**Do you credit the source of the data?**:
Yes

## Expected Implications
Our expected implications regarding our research questions, could result in the idea of the fault lines that are created by policymakers and lack of action from social workers. There are a numerous factors that could motivate one to commit suicide. However, to commit these actions is also a reflection of the lack of action of others. The main motivation for suicide could be due to feeling neglected or downturned from others in times of need. This includes social workers, whether its a teacher, counselor, etc. And policymakers may also be a leading factor to these faults, as the lack of restrictive policies may give a leeway for those to freely commit harmful or negative actions towards someone without repercussions.

## Limitations
There are a few limitations when exploring our research for this project. The first main issue and limitation that our group could possibly come across would be the inability to find data on suicide rates. For example, we could use our knowledge of recent world events to justify the prediction of increased suicide rates, though it may be difficult to find data to support this theory. Another possible limitation we could come across throughout this research project would be our lack of experience with coding and creating websites. This is our first time coding for the majority of us and we expect that we will have difficulty coding the actual project or not being able to add features that we desire.
