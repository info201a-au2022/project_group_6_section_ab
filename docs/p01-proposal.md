## Abstract
Our main question is how does social media correlate with mental health? We are concerned with the fact that because social media is more prominent in today’s culture, this could negatively impact the mental health of users. To address this concern, we plan to take a closer look to see whether or not our theory is accurate in regards to social media’s connection to poor mental health.

## Introduction
Within the year 2020, the United States alone estimated that there were 1.20 million attempted suicides and about 46,000 actual deaths. According to the CDC’s  article “Facts About Suicide”, when someone does suicide and or attempts it, the mental health and well-being of friends, loved ones, co-workers, and the community is negatively affected. Many times these loved ones will also experience feelings of shock, anger, guilt, symptoms of depression or anxiety. The only way we can change this and protect each other is by talking about these hard topics and being there for one another. It is very important for people to understand how much of an impact this has on our society as a whole.

What are the main reasons people have poor mental health? Social media plays a large role in the decrease of users' mental health. Therefore, the topic that our group decided to tackle is the impact of mental health due to a social media setting. Our project will be structured in a way where we will display various statistics and data sets including the increased usage of social media over the years, cyberbullying, the mental health of teens, and negative effects of social media on the mental health of U.S. teens.

Our team’s values align with this research topic because bringing awareness to mental health is something we feel strongly about. This is due to the fact that first hand, we as teens, have experienced various losses due to cyberbullying and poor mental health. According to S.Dixon article about “Teen perspectives on negative effects of social media in the U.S. 2018”,  studies show the leading reasons why teenagers ultimately feel as though social media has a negative impact on their lives. According to his statistics the leading causes for teen depression is caused by bullying/spreading rumors through the use of social media. We believe that a large reason as to why suicide rates have increased and why the mental health of teens have worsened over the years is due to the increased usage of social media and how prominent it is within our lives.

Direct stakeholders in regards to the correlation between mental health and social media could include other students, teens, social media users, and etc. On the other hand, indirect stakeholders, and people who are impacted without use would be families of teenagers, friends, and etc.

Possible harms to not tackling the issue in regards to the correlation between mental health and social media could be kept a silent issue. Many times these loved ones/close friends also experience feelings of shock, anger, guilt, symptoms of depression or anxiety. It is important that we bring awareness to this subject because too many lives are being impacted by social media in a negative way. The benefit to discussing this topic is that awareness and attention is brought to this subject.

## Research questions
**_What age group has social media become more prominent in over the years?_**
The question, “What age group has social media become more prominent in over the years?” is an important topic to cover because our research indicates that social media use has increased compared to years past and statistics would help to make our argument stronger. This question is motivated by the fact that we want to narrow down the population and age group we want to focus on.

**_Is cyberbullying a large issue amongst social media users?_**
The question, “How is cyberbullying a large issue amongst social media users?” is an important topic to cover because cyberbullying can have a negative impact on social media users. This question is motivated by the want to explore the darker side of using social media.

**_What has changed in regards to the mental health of teens over the years?_**
The question, “What has changed in regards to the mental health of teens over the years?” is an important topic to cover because we are likely to find statistics and information on how teens’ mental health has plummeted over the years. This question is motivated by the want to prove that poor mental health amongst teens have a large possibility of being connected to increased social media usage.

**_What are the negative effects of social media on the mental health of U.S. teens?_**
The question, “What are the negative effects of social media on the mental health of U.S. teens?” is an important topic to cover because we are able to take a closer look at teens, who are the large majority of social media users. This question is motivated by exploring specific aspects within social media and examining how teens react.

## The Dataset
Our dataset specifically focuses on the negative impacts of social media towards teens emotional well being. Our research and problem domain focuses on these impacts, and our questions reach beyond the surfaces of social media issues. With this, we strived to find a dataset that will allow us to breach these questions, hence the choice of our dataset. Our dataset provides important information such as, visualization of the data comparison between each set of questions they’ve set; the questions set, lead way to answering our main question of if social media is a leading factor to the mental health of users. Our dataset also provides statistics on a variety of aspects of this topic. From our data, it will be beneficial to our usage as it provides data on not only specifically on the negative impacts of media towards teens but as well as data regarding cyber bullying, online access, and social usage. These different aspects provided by our dataset allows us to extend our research beyond a restricted focus and look into varying factors that play into users' usage of media.

Yes

## Expected Implications
Our expected implications regarding our research questions, could result in the idea of the fault lines that are created by policymakers and technologists. Social media gives users the platform to freely express themselves. However, by policies made from the policymakers of these platforms, there can be a leeway for negative effects towards a user's experience. As our research questions strive to answer, how social factors and media correlate to these issues? And how can the actions of cyberbullying be a result of the faulty of poorly created policies that disregard the safety and privacy of users who fall victim to cyberbullying. With this, we can assume that these actions leading to a low social-emotional well being of a user can be correlated to the fault of these creators who allow social factors, such as, cyberbullying to be prevalent on their platforms.

## Limitations
There are a few limitations when exploring our research for this project. The first main issue and limitation that our group could possibly come across would be the inability to find data on if social media is the root cause of negative mental health issues and suicide rates. For example, we could use our knowledge in regards to the expansion of social media across our community over the years to explain the increase in poor mental health and suicide rates, though it may be difficult to find data to support this theory. Another possible limitation we could come across throughout this research project would be our lack of experience with coding and creating websites. This is our first time coding for the majority of us and we expect that we will have difficulty coding the actual project or not being able to add features that we desire.
