## What is this file for?



## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!!

## Table 

```{r Table}
source("../source/table.R")
table.R()
```
This aggregated table is a downsized and clean version of our who_suicide_statistics dataset. 
The purpose of downsizing our dataset is to steer more towards the focus of our research questions. 
We included information regarding data specifically from the U.S only; year, sex, both data from genders (female and male), age, suicide numbers, and population size. 

## Charts

```{r chart 3, echo=FALSE}
source("../source/barchart.R")
barchart.R()
```
This is a bar chart that examines suicide numbers between genders over the years.
Within this chart, we include suicide numbers (y) over the years 1980 till 2010+ (x).
We also include two variables (female and male), depicted by the blue and orange bars shown on our chart. 
This is to show the drastic difference between suicides between genders. 

```{r chart 1, echo=FALSE}
source("../source/scatterplot.R")
scatterplot.R()
